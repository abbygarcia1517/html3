	<h3>Understanding play.</h3>
	<p>Thinking back to my childhood, I reflect on where a lot of my<b>creativity sparked</b> from and that was through play.<br/>Play was a way for me to bring my imagination to life and it was super fun!</p>

	<h3>"It might sound silly to some, but being able to be creative with dolls takes so much stress away from me."</h3>
	<p>There's something so awesome about being able to make small items look life size!<br/>Life is so crazy, so when I can stop and create; the world seems so small.<br/>All my stress disappers.<br/>The photo below contains my mini me Babrie that my husband found for me.<br/>In addition, I built the closet in the background from scratch.</p>
